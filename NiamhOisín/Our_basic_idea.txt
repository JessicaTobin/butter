Create a device that tells the temperature of each room in the school. There is a perfect temperature to study at (21-23Â°C). 
Students love to complain about the room being too cold or too warm, and teachers do bloody nothing about it.
"Hey sir, Its a bit chilly in here innit?"  "Ye but no"
The device will tell whether it is too cold or too warm. 
Our device will be in each room and will send regular readings to a website. Here we will be able have an overlay of the school and see which 
rooms are too warm or too cold.

This device will also tell students when leaving the room last class the temperature outisde. It will either tell them to wrap up and pop on a hat
or to slap a bit of sun cream on and enjoy the sunny evening.
